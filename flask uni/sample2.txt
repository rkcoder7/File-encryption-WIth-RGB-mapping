A single number that results from combining the three components of each vector in an
RGB value is used to generate a pixel matrix. These pixel matrices are then merged to form a
pixelated encrypted images. Moreover, users need to set an eight digit passkey. The passkey is
used to generate a slotted frame, which is then hashed with SHA-256 to create a new pixelated
image. The new image is then added to the existing images, these images are then
converted/restructured one by one into another normal images so nobody can suspect it is an
encrypted image. Then the converted images are ordered in a sequence in each page to create
a PDF file. Finally, the data needs to be reversed to unlock the original file in a secure manner.
